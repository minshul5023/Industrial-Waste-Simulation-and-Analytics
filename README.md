# ‚ôªÔ∏è Industrial Waste Simulation and Analytics

## üîç Project Overview

A comprehensive project aimed at building an end-to-end framework for industrial waste management. The focus areas included simulating process flows, optimizing waste handling, and evaluating environmental impacts. Real-world case studies‚Äîsuch as sugar industry optimization and plastic pyrolysis‚Äîwere analyzed to propose sustainable and cost-effective waste valorization strategies.

**Key Objectives**  
- Develop process flow diagrams (PFDs) for industrial systems  
- Simulate mass and energy balances to identify inefficiencies  
- Perform Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) analysis  
- Propose valorization strategies and evaluate cost-benefit trade-offs
